## What is it?

The plugin Adblock monetization by AdBack lets you monetize the part of your audience unreachable with your classic monetization tools: the adblock users. This plugin offers a solution only for this target. Your normal ads will be shown to the rest of your audience.

## How does it work?

Display a footer message offering your users the possibility to turn off their adblocker or to click on an ad to access the website.

In any case, you monetize your site thanks to the adblocker deactivation (ads on your website are displayed again) or with the click on the ad. Monetization and performance guaranteed!

Access the dashboard with simple statistics:
* Revenues
* Number of click on the ad
* Number of message display
* Number of blocked page views

## Pricing

The solution is free, without subscription or obligation. You’re gaining money everytime a user clicks on the ad. NO FEE, ONLY BONUS!

## Installation

Activate the plugin and let the magic begin. The configuration is automatic and activated instantly on your site.
Available in English and French.
